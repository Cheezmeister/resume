# Community Involvement

## What I hope you take away from this

I love technology and I feel grateful that I can making a living do something that I gladly do for free/fun. I have received so much from the Open Source community that I am honored to be able to give back. I don't have the elitist developer mentality. I seek qualities in others and address them in a way to improve those qualities.
