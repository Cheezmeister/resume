\blocktitle{Objective}
\begin{longtext}
    I have a vision for what is next for my company.
    I want to see all of our content responsive to screens of any size.
    Our concept of mobile should encompass Connected TVs, Blu-ray players, set-top boxes, and game consoles.
    I'm going to convince you to incorporate into apps features that only apps can have, that justify them being apps.
    I want to see Medley provide tools for curating content for devices that makes it a natural part of the workflow.
    We're going to build an architecture with inconsequential publishing delays. They will no longer be discussed.
    I have seen this company through "the draining of the swamp" and the toilsome have-to-dos. I want to be the person who leads us into the want-to-dos.
%    The Mobile Architect position gives clarity to the role I have served technically since 2010.
%    It plays into my strength of deep diving into extremely complex systems and making them accessible to various audiences.
%    It answers questions I have had about my role in vendor and site relationships.
