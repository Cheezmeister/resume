## This is my resume. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
I am a coder. I write code. I coded my [resume in LaTeX] because that is the way I want to maintain it. I have made it available in [PDF form][1] because it is reliable. Do not ask for it in "Word" format.

## This repo is special
There are many resumes on github. This repo is unique because it is also the source code for the popular [richardbronosky/latex-compiler] Docker image.
